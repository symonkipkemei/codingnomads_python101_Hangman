<INTRODUCTION>

<h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>

## The hangman game

Hangman is a classic CLI (command line interface) game that allows a user to guess the letters of a pre-defined word. The user has a set amount of tries to guess the full word before they lose and have to suffer their unfortunate fate.

### Highlights:
 - The computer knows the word.
 - Your part/role is to guess the word by inputing single alphabets that constitute the word at a time.
 - you can only input a single alphabet at a time!
 - if your guess is correct, the computer will replace the '_" with the right alphabet.
 - You have a few attempts!
 - All the best!
