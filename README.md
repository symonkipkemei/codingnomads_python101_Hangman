# PROJECT: Hangman

Now that you've learned all the pieces that made up the guess-the-number game, it's time to build your own CLI game with Python!

# Hangman

Hangman is another classic game! Your task for this project is to create a CLI game that allows a user to guess the letters of a pre-defined word. They should have a set amount of tries to guess the full word before they lose and have to suffer their unfortunate fate:
You can implement this game however you want to. Don't try to make it too complicated yet! You can come back to your game and make it more interesting later on. Start by building a basic, but functional implementation, for example, this could be your pseudocode:

# pseudocode

 Hard-code a word that needs to be guessed in the script
 Print an explanation to the user
 Display the word as a sequence of blanks, e.g. "_ _ _ _ _" for "hello"
 Ask for user input
 Allow only single-character alphabetic input
 Create a counter for how many tries a user has
 Keep asking them for their guess until they won or lost
 When they find a correct character, display the blank with the word
 filled in, e.g.: "_ e _ _ _" if they guessed "e" from "hello"
 Display a winning message and the full word if they win
 Display a losing message and quit the game if they don't make it
